#Login Example Backend
This is the backend for a simple application that was built for the Introduction to SproutCore traning series put on by Strobe. It is meant to facilitate the learning of SproutCore, and is not a good example of a clean Rails application. You can view the SproutCore application that uses this backend [here](https://github.com/gmoeck/login_example).
